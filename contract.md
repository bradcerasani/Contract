## Summary: 

We’ll always do our best to fulfil your needs and meet your expectations, but it’s important to have things written down so that we both know what’s what, who should do what and when, and what will happen if something goes wrong. In this contract you won’t find any complicated legal terms or long passages of unreadable text. We’ve no desire to trick you into signing something that you might later regret. What we do want is what’s best for both parties, now and in the future.

So in short;

You ([customer name]), located at [customer address] are hiring us ([company name]) located at [company address] to [design and develop a web site] for the estimated total price of [total] as outlined in our previous correspondence.

## What do both parties agree to do? 

*You:* You have the authority to enter into this contract on behalf of yourself, your company or your organisation. You’ll give us everything we need to complete the project as and when and in the format we need it. You’ll review our work, provide feedback and approval in a timely manner too. Deadlines work two ways, so you’ll also be bound by dates we set together. You also agree to stick to the payment schedule set out at the end of this contract.

*Us:* We have the experience and ability to do everything we’ve agreed with you and we’ll do it all in a professional and timely manner. We’ll endeavour to meet every deadline that’s set and on top of that we'll maintain the confidentiality of everything you give us.

## Details 

### Design 

We create designs and flexible layouts that adapt to the capabilities of many devices and screen sizes. We create designs iteratively and use predominantly HTML and CSS so we won’t waste time mocking up every template as a static visual. We may use static visuals to indicate a look-and-feel direction (colour, texture and typography).

You’ll have plenty of opportunities to review our work and provide feedback.

### Text content 

We’re not responsible for writing or inputting any text copy. If you’d like us to write new content or input text for you, we can provide a separate estimate for that.

### Graphics

You should supply graphic files in an editable, vector digital format. Sketch (.sketch) or Adobe Illustrator (.ai) files are preferred, but .eps files are fine too.

### Photographs 

You should supply photographs in a high resolution digital format. If you choose to buy stock photographs, we can suggest stock libraries. If you’d like us to search for and license photographs for you, we can provide a separate estimate for that.

### HTML, CSS and JavaScript

We deliver web page types developed from HTML5 markup, CSS3 stylesheets for styling and JavaScript for feature detection, poly-fills and behaviours. Depending on the specific requirements of your project, we may use other web technologies and languages in the development of your website.

### Browser testing

Browser testing _is not_ an attempt to make a website look the same in browsers with differing capabilities or on devices with varying screen resolutions. Browser testing _is_ ensuring that a user’s experience is appropriate to the capabilities of a browser or device.

### Desktop browser testing

We test our work in current versions of all major desktop browsers including those made by Apple (Safari), Google (Chrome), Microsoft (Internet Explorer), Mozilla Firefox and Opera. We will not test versions of Internet Explorer 9 or earlier, nor will we test other older browsers unless you specify otherwise. If you need an enhanced design for an older browser, we can provide a separate estimate for that.

### Mobile browser testing

We test our work on iOS and Android tablets and phones using the following browsers: 

iOS: Safari, Google Chrome 
Android 4.x: Google Chrome and Firefox

We currently don’t test Blackberry, Opera Mini/Mobile, or other mobile browsers. If you need us to test using these, we can provide a separate estimate for that.

# 3rd Party Products and Services

3rd party products and services like domain name registration, website hosting, and email hosting are _not_ included in the website design and development fee. If 3rd party products and services are required for your project, they will be included as separate line items on your estimate, or in a separate estimate altogether. We do not markup these products and services; what we pay is what you pay.

### Hosting and Deployment

If you currently have a hosting plan, we will deploy your new website to your host's server. If you do not have a hosting plan or if your current hosting plan is deemed inadequate, we will make our best hosting recommendation based on the resource requirements of your new website. We will do a basic setup and configuration of your hosting environment to ensure your website runs quickly and securely. If we are setting up a new hosting account for you with a 3rd party, we can provide a separate estimate for that.

### Email

If you require email for your domain name, we can provide an estimate for that. 

### Analytics

We’re not a website hosting company so we don’t offer support for website hosting, email or other services relating to hosting. You may already have professional hosting and you might even manage that hosting in-house; if you do, great. If you don’t, we can set up an account for you at one of our preferred hosting providers. We can set up your site on a server, plus any statistics software such as Google Analytics and we can provide a separate estimate for that. Then, the updates to, and management of that server will be up to you.

### Changes and revisions 

We know from experience that fixed-price contracts are rarely beneficial to you, as they often limit you to your earliest ideas. We don’t want to limit your ability to change your mind. The price at the beginning of this contract is based on the length of time we estimate we’ll need to accomplish everything you’ve told us you want to achieve, but we’re happy to be flexible. If you want to change your mind or add anything new, that won’t be a problem as we’ll provide a separate estimate for that.

### Legal stuff 

We can’t guarantee that our work will be error-free and so we can’t be liable to you or any third-party for damages, including lost profits, lost savings or other incidental, consequential or special damages, even if you’ve advised us of them. Finally, if any provision of this contract shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from this contract and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
 
Phew.

### Copyrights 

First, you guarantee that all elements of text, images or other artwork you provide are either owned by your good selves, or that you’ve permission to use them.

Then, when your final payment has cleared, copyright will be automatically assigned as follows:

You’ll own the visual elements that we create for this project. We’ll give you source files and finished files and you should keep them somewhere safe as we’re not required to keep a copy. You own all elements of text, images and data you provided, unless someone else owns them. 

We’ll own the unique combination of these elements that constitutes a complete design and we’ll license its use to you, exclusively and in perpetuity for this project only, unless we agree otherwise.

We love to show off our work and share what we’ve learned with other people, so we reserve the right, with your permission, to display and link to your project as part of our portfolio and to write about it on websites, in magazine articles and in books.

### Payments 

We’re sure you understand how important it is as a small business that you pay the invoices that we send you promptly. As we’re also sure you’ll want to stay friends, you agree to stick tight to the following payment schedule.

[Payment schedule]

### But where’s all the horrible small print? 

You promise to pay me the total sum (“Fee”) of $Price (CA Dollars) in two payments. Fifty percent (50%) of the Fee will be due when you and I sign this Agreement and before I begin. The remaining fifty percent (50%) of the Fee will be due immediately before I send you final files containing the software you approved. Payment will be made using online payment/ cheque.  If you ask me to use any third-party content (such as stock photos or third party software that must be incorporated in the software I am creating for you), you promise to pay me the actual cost of licensing that third-party content for work under this Agreement. You agree that until you pay me in full, you will not acquire the rights or license to use or transfer ownership of any software that I create for you under this Agreement.

Just like a parking ticket, you can’t transfer this contract to anyone else without our permission. This contract stays in place and need not be renewed. If for some reason one part of this contract becomes invalid or unenforceable, the remaining parts of it remain in place. 

Although the language is simple, the intentions are serious and this contract is a legal document under exclusive jurisdiction of [English and Welsh] courts. 

Oh and don’t forget those men with big dogs.
