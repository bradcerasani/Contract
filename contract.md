# Contract

## Terms and definitions

**‘This document’** refers to this contract and the terms and agreements within it.

**‘The Work’** refers to the project for which this document was actioned.

**‘You’** refers to the client or company on behalf of whom The Work is commissioned.

**‘I’** refers to me, Brad Cerasani, working for You on behalf of Shedbot New Media.

This document exists to protect the interests of all involved parties, to outline our responsibilities to one another, and to avoid any confusion or disappointment during and/or after our time working together.

If any part of this document is unclear please do not hesitate to contact me for clarification. Each project I undertake will have its own particular set of nuances, so I am willing and able to modify this document to suit the requirements of The Work. Any amendments and/or additions must be requested prior to the signing of this document.

## What do both parties agree to do?

You have the authority to enter into this document on behalf of yourself, your company or your organization. You’ll give me everything I need to complete The Work as and when I need it. You agree to stick to the payment schedule described at the end of this document.

I have the experience and expertise to do everything I’ve agreed to and I’ll do it all in a professional and timely manner. I'll do my best to meet every deadline we set together, and maintain the confidentiality of everything You give me.

## Scope of The Work

The estimate You received outlines the scope of The Work and its fees. Emails and other documents discussing the scope of The Work are supplementary to this document.

### Change in scope

There are times when the scope of The Work may change. Together we will handle these as-and-when, and in a pragmatic manner, but major deviations in scope may require renegotiation of fees and/or the terms of this document.

## Process

I design primarily in the browser, creating flexible layouts that adapt to the capabilities of many devices and screen sizes. I work iteratively, using predominantly HTML, CSS and Javascript to build out interactive prototypes instead of static visuals.

Along the way, You will have ample opportunity to review my work and provide feedback.

## Content

### Text Copy

I'm not responsible for writing or inputting any text copy. If You require new copy or text input, I can provide a separate estimate for that.

### Graphics

You should supply logos and other  graphic files in an editable, vector digital format. Sketch (.sketch) or Adobe Illustrator (.ai) files are preferred, but EPS (.eps) files are fine too.

### Photographs

You should supply photographs in high-resolution JPG (.jpg) format. If You choose to buy stock photographs, I can suggest stock libraries. If you’d like me to search for and license photographs on your behalf, I can provide a separate estimate for that.

## Browser testing

Browser testing is ensuring that a user’s experience is appropriate to the capabilities of a browser or device.

### Desktop

The Work will be tested in all major desktop browsers including those made by Apple (Safari), Google (Chrome), Microsoft (Internet Explorer), Mozilla Firefox and Opera. The Work will not be tested in versions of Internet Explorer 9 or earlier, nor will it be tested in other older browsers unless You specify otherwise. If You require an enhanced design for an older browser, I can provide a separate estimate for that.

### Mobile

The Work will be tested in iOS Safari and Google Chrome, and Android 4.x in Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox.  If You require testing in other mobile browsers, I can provide a separate estimate for that.

## Third-Party Products and Services

Third-party products and services including but not limited to domain name registration, website hosting, and email hosting are not included in the website design and development fee. If third-party products and services are required for your project, they will be included as separate line items on your estimate or in a separate estimate altogether. I do not markup these products and services; what I pay is what you pay.

### Hosting and Deployment

If You currently have a hosting plan, I will deploy your new website to your existing server. If You do not have a hosting plan or if your current hosting plan is deemed inadequate, I will make my best hosting recommendation based on the resource requirements of your new website.

### Email

If You require email for your domain name, I can provide a separate estimate for that.

### Analytics

I will install and configure Google Analytics for your website, enabling You to access to rich data about your users. If You require a more advanced analytics installation, I can provide a separate estimate for that.

## Amends and Maintenance

Any amends which do not drastically alter the scope of The Work do not require renegotiation of fees or this document.

Due to the incredibly complex nature of modern web development, The Work cannot be guaranteed to be bug free. I can’t be liable to You or any third-party for damages, including lost profits, lost savings or other incidental, consequential or special damages, even if you’ve advised me of them. That being said, any bugs discovered within 14 days of project end will be fixed as a matter of course, and require no renegotiation of terms. Maintenance of The Work after this period is not covered by the project fees unless explicitly stated otherwise.

### Backups

When your final payment clears, I’ll give You source files and finished files and You should keep them somewhere safe. While I utilize secure on-site, off-site, and cloud based backups of all my work, I cannot promise to keep copies of your data indefinitely. After project end, keeping copies of this data is your responsibility.

## Disclosure

I often like to write and tweet about the projects I work on; if there is no NDA in place I shall assume that You authorize me to do this. If You prefer otherwise, please let me know before signing this document.

## Copyrights

You guarantee that all text, images, and/or other elements You provide are either owned by You, or that You have obtained permission to use them.

When your final payment clears, copyright will be automatically assigned as follows:

You’ll own the visual elements that I create for The Work. I’ll own the unique combination of these elements that constitutes a complete design and license its use to You, exclusively and in perpetuity for this project only.

## Payment

An upfront deposit of 50% is required before beginning The Work. This deposit is non-refundable and will only be paid once a fixed scope has been established and both parties have agreed to the terms and conditions of this document.

If, at any stage, You decide to no longer proceed with The Work, you'll pay me in full for everything I've produced until that point and cancel this contract.

The remaining balance, plus any taxes and expenses, is due at or before launch.

### Late payment

Failure to meet agreed payment terms (primarily, but not limited to, late payment) will incur penalty in the form of 5% of the total project cost for each calendar week of late payment. This penalty fee shall be paid on top of any outstanding invoices.

### Legal

If any provision of this contract shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from this contract and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.

### Signatures

The undersigned hereby acknowledge and agree to the terms and conditions described in this document.
