# Contract 

### Terms and definitions

*‘This document’* refers to this contract and the terms and agreements within it.
*‘The Work’* refers to the project for which this document was actioned.
*‘You’* refers to the client or company on behalf of whom The Work is commissioned.
*‘I’* refers to me, Brad Cerasani, working for You on behalf of Shedbot New Media.

This document exists to protect the interests of all involved parties, to outline our responsibilities to one another, and to avoid any confusion or disappointment during and/or after our time working together. 

If any part of this document is unclear please do not hesitate to contact me for clarification. Each project I undertake will have its own particular set of nuances, so I am able and willing to modify this document to suit the needs of The Work. Any amendments and/or additions must be requested prior to the signing of this document.

### What do both parties agree to do? 

*You:* You have the authority to enter into this document on behalf of yourself, your company or your organization. You’ll give me everything I need to complete The Work as and when I need it. You agree to stick to the payment schedule described at the end of this document.

*I:* I have the experience and expertise to do everything we’ve agreed to and I’ll do it all in a professional and timely manner. I'll do my best to meet every deadline we set together, and maintain the confidentiality of everything you give me.

## Details 

### Design 

I design and develop flexible layouts that adapt to the capabilities of many devices and screen sizes. I work iteratively and design primarily in the browser instead of with static visuals.

### Text content 

I'm not responsible for writing or inputting any text copy. If you require new copy or text input, I can provide a separate estimate for that.

### Graphics

You should supply graphic files in an editable, vector digital format. Sketch (.sketch) or Adobe Illustrator (.ai) files are preferred, but .eps files are fine too.

### Photographs 

You should supply photographs in a high resolution digital format. If you choose to buy stock photographs, I can suggest stock libraries. If you’d like me to search for and license photographs for you, I can provide a separate estimate for that.

### HTML, CSS and JavaScript

We deliver web page types developed from HTML5 markup, CSS3 stylesheets for styling and JavaScript for feature detection, poly-fills and behaviours. Depending on the specific requirements of your project, we may use other web technologies and languages in the development of your website.

## Browser testing

Browser testing _is not_ an attempt to make a website look the same in browsers with differing capabilities or on devices with varying screen resolutions. Browser testing _is_ ensuring that a user’s experience is appropriate to the capabilities of a browser or device.

### Desktop browser testing

We test our work in current versions of all major desktop browsers including those made by Apple (Safari), Google (Chrome), Microsoft (Internet Explorer), Mozilla Firefox and Opera. We will not test versions of Internet Explorer 9 or earlier, nor will we test other older browsers unless you specify otherwise. If you need an enhanced design for an older browser, we can provide a separate estimate for that.

### Mobile browser testing

We test our work on iOS and Android tablets and phones using the following browsers: 

iOS: Safari, Google Chrome 
Android 4.x: Google Chrome and Firefox

We currently don’t test Blackberry, Opera Mini/Mobile, or other mobile browsers. If you need us to test using these, we can provide a separate estimate for that.

# 3rd Party Products and Services

3rd party products and services such as domain name registration, website hosting, and email hosting are _not_ included in the website design and development fee. If 3rd party products and services are required for your project, they will be included as separate line items on your estimate or in a separate estimate altogether. We do not markup these products and services; what we pay is what you pay.

### Hosting and Deployment

If you currently have a hosting plan, we will deploy your new website to your existing server. If you do not have a hosting plan or if your current hosting plan is deemed inadequate, we will make our best hosting recommendation based on the resource requirements of your new website. We are not a hosting company, but If we are setting up a new hosting account for you with a 3rd party, we can provide a separate estimate for that.

### Email

If you require email for your domain name, we can provide an estimate for that.

### Analytics



### Revisions, Amends, and Maintenance

Any amends which do not drastically alter the scope of The Work do not require renegotiation of costs or this document.

For any changes that alter the scope of The Work, please see the Change in scope section of this document.

Any bugs, which, unfortunately, cannot be guaranteed against, that are directly related to The Work, and are discovered within two weeks of the end of The Work, shall be fixed as a matter of course, and require no renegotiation of terms. I also apologise in advance if we should ever find ourselves in this situation.

Maintenance of The Work is not covered by either the project’s costs or this document unless explicitly agreed. 

### Legal stuff 

We can’t guarantee that our work will be error-free and so we can’t be liable to you or any third-party for damages, including lost profits, lost savings or other incidental, consequential or special damages, even if you’ve advised us of them. Finally, if any provision of this contract shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from this contract and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
 
Phew.

### Copyrights 

First, you guarantee that all elements of text, images or other artwork you provide are either owned by your good selves, or that you’ve permission to use them.

Then, when your final payment has cleared, copyright will be automatically assigned as follows:

You’ll own the visual elements that we create for this project. We’ll give you source files and finished files and you should keep them somewhere safe as we’re not required to keep a copy. You own all elements of text, images and data you provided, unless someone else owns them. 

We’ll own the unique combination of these elements that constitutes a complete design and we’ll license its use to you, exclusively and in perpetuity for this project only, unless we agree otherwise.

We love to show off our work and share what we’ve learned with other people, so we reserve the right, with your permission, to display and link to your project as part of our portfolio and to write about it on websites, in magazine articles and in books.

### Payments 

We’re sure you understand how important it is as a small business that you pay the invoices that we send you promptly. As we’re also sure you’ll want to stay friends, you agree to stick tight to the following payment schedule.

[Payment schedule]

### But where’s all the horrible small print? 

You promise to pay me the total sum (“Fee”) of $Price (CA Dollars) in two payments. Fifty percent (50%) of the Fee will be due when you and I sign this Agreement and before I begin. The remaining fifty percent (50%) of the Fee will be due immediately before I send you final files containing the software you approved. Payment will be made using online payment/ cheque.  If you ask me to use any third-party content (such as stock photos or third party software that must be incorporated in the software I am creating for you), you promise to pay me the actual cost of licensing that third-party content for work under this Agreement. You agree that until you pay me in full, you will not acquire the rights or license to use or transfer ownership of any software that I create for you under this Agreement.

Just like a parking ticket, you can’t transfer this contract to anyone else without our permission. This contract stays in place and need not be renewed. If for some reason one part of this contract becomes invalid or unenforceable, the remaining parts of it remain in place. 

Although the language is simple, the intentions are serious and this contract is a legal document under exclusive jurisdiction of [English and Welsh] courts. 

Oh and don’t forget those men with big dogs.
